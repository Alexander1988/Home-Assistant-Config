<p align="center">I have made the move to a package-based configuration.</p> 
<p align="center">This will make it easier for anyone that wants to use a certain part of my configuration as all parts are in the one yaml file rather then having to search through multiple yalm files to find what pertains to a certain intergration.</p> 
<p align="center">I have also merged all of my includes into a folder as a way of cleaning up my configuration files.</p> 
<p align="center">I have uploaded new screenshots to reflect the changes made since I first uploaded them.</p> 
<p align="center">My lovelace UI is a constant work in progress config and screenshots are available and updated as I change them.</p>
